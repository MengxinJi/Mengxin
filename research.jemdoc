= Research

My research mainly focuses on causal inference and machine learning. More specifically:

- Heterogeneous causal inference.
- Recommendation System on large-scale and high-dimensional electronic healthcare databases.
- Energy efficiency

=== Recommendation System of Optimized Matchmaking in Health Care

In this project, we applied and investigated Recommendation System algorithms to increase the likelihood of long-lasting relationships, preventive medicine and quality of follow ups in health care, and implemented different machine learning algorithms to develop automated mediation service. \[[https://dssg.uchicago.edu/project/jose-de-melo-saude/ Link]\]


=== Heterogeneous Bay Bridge Impacts on Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Ridership

In this project, we investigated heterogeneous effect from new Bay Bridge on BART ridership based on hour and routelevel dimensions using some causal inference methods; in addition, we investigated new Bay Bridge social impact by cost and benefit analysis from traffic congestion and air pollution aspects. To better understand the transit pattern, we visualized the throughput of the BART among 45 stations, from 2011 to 2015, with more than 40 million ridership record. The motion chart could be found on my [https://github.com/MengxinJi/BayArea_Bart_Explore/blob/master/output_hlFikR.gif github]


=== Policy Causal Impact on California Soda Market Consumption Pattern

This project mainly mined and inference the causality between the policy and the soft drink market consumption in California using some causal inference methods. We investigated causal inference method (triple difference approach) based on the all California supermarkets household level consumptionâ€™s with transaction details.



=== Energy Prediction of Peaking Power Plant in California

[img{200}{128}{alt text} figure/energy.png]

We predicted the demand of power to reduce the cost of building unnecessary power plants using super- vised learning methods and applied and investigated multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g. OLS, ridge regression, Lasso, decision tree, random forest model) in pySpark to process the large database.
